Weblorg is an Emacs-Lisp API rather than a command line tool. The use
of the API becomes the description of a pipeline that takes lists of
Org-Mode files as input, templatize them and generate HTML files as an
output. e.g.:

#+begin_src shell
blog/
├── posts
│   └── my-first-post.org
└── publish.el
#+end_src

On ~publish.el~ is the Weblorg configuration file, you can configure
routes, theme and other things. This is the minimal setup for a blog.

#+begin_src lisp
(use-package weblorg)

(weblorg-route
 :name "posts"
 :input-pattern "posts/.*\\.org$"
 :template "post.html"
 :output "output/posts/{{ slug }}.html"
 :url "/posts/{{ slug }}.html")

(weblorg-route
 :name "index"
 :input-pattern "posts/.*\\.org$"
 :input-aggregate #'weblorg-input-aggregate-all-desc
 :template "blog.html"
 :output "output/index.html"
 :url "/")
     
(weblorg-export)
#+end_src

To generate your blog touched by unicorn just run

#+begin_src shell
emacs --script publish.el
#+end_src
