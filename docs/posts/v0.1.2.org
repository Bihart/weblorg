#+TITLE: v0.1.2 - Slowly but Surely
#+DATE: <2021-09-19 Fri>

* Intro

  After quite a bit of time and work, here is the second public
  release of *weblorg*, the modern Static HTML Generator for Emacs and
  Org-Mode.

  The most exciting thing about this release was the contributions to
  both /templatel/ and /weblorg/ from the following people (in
  lexicographical order): [[https://github.com/AblatedSprocket][AblatedSprocket]], [[https://github.com/guilhermecomum/][Guilherme Guerra]], [[https://github.com/semente][Guilherme
  Semente]], [[https://lauragroetzinger.com][Laura Groetzinger]], [[https://github.com/markokocic][Marko Kocić]], [[https://github.com/nanzhong][Nan Zhong]], and [[https://github.com/mrmechko][Rik]].  Thanks
  a lot, you guys! <3

  The biggest improvements all these folks brought to you were around
  how themes are structured, how we can have a better blogging
  experience, and lots of bug fixes.  Both [[url_for:docs,slug=index][documentation]] and [[url_for:api][API]]
  reference were also improved, but there is still a lot to be covered
  there. It will continue to be a top priority for the next releases.

  Here's a glimpse of the default theme, in case you are curious

** Templatel 0.1.6

   On the [[https://clarete.li/templatel][templatel]] side, two new versions were shipped: ~0.1.5~ and
   ~0.1.6~, which was the biggest release made so far and includes the
   following highlights:

   * Support ~{% include %}~ statements (Thanks to [[https://github.com/guilhermecomum/][Guilherme Guerra]])
   * New filters added: ~take~ (Thanks to [[https://github.com/markokocic][Marko Kocić]]), ~abs~,
     ~capitalize~, ~escape~ (~e~), ~float~, ~join~, ~length~, ~max~,
     ~min~, ~round~, and ~title~.
   * Added test operator that is another syntax for passing parameters
     to functions that have a defined signature, they must return a
     Boolean value. e.g.: ~{% if something is defined %}~.

* Next Steps

  There's quite a bit of work left to do, but the priorities going
  forward seem clear: better blogging experience, more themes.  That
  being said there are other important changes in the works too.
  Here's a list of some of the planned work ahead:

  - [[https://github.com/emacs-love/weblorg/issues/32#issuecomment-913791560][#32 - Mix input handlers in the same route]]: this will allow
    *weblorg* to generate websites recursively a directory scanning
    for Org-Mode and asset files in one route.

  - [[https://github.com/emacs-love/weblorg/issues/27][#27 - Control over file names generation]]: Right now *weblorg* uses
    either the ~#+SLUG~ file property, or the slugified ~#+TITLE~, or
    the original file name with the ~.org~ suffix replaced with
    ~.html~.  This work will allow users to have full control over it,
    but with very good defaults.

  - [[https://github.com/emacs-love/weblorg/issues/48][#48 - API for interacting with routes from within templates]]:
    There's an undocumented function ~weblorg_route_posts~ that allows
    listing posts of any route in the site from any template, however
    it's far from where we want it to be.  For example, this post is
    newer than the ~0.1.1~ post, but that function doesn't take a
    sorting parameter :/ and that's the type of thing we want to fix
    here.

  - [[https://github.com/emacs-love/weblorg/issues/31][#31 Watch file notifications]]: The goal is to improve the
    development experience by re-generating automatically upon file
    changes. (thanks [[https://github.com/nanzhong][Nan Zhong]])

  - [[https://github.com/emacs-love/weblorg/issues/43][#43 - Site specific template filters]]: low hanging fruit for making
    *weblorg* more extensible.

  - Other core features that still need work: wrap up support for
    [[https://github.com/emacs-love/weblorg/issues/5][categories]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-love/weblorg/issues/10][tags]]

  - It would be great to start covering the interactive use *weblorg*.
    Although running from the command line via ~--script~ is still a
    high priority, this is very important for local development.

  These are top priorities for now, but if you think I missed
  something, or you thought of something new, please go ahead and let
  me know by opening a [[https://github.com/emacs-love/weblorg/issues][GitHub issue]]. Thanks in advance :)

  See you next release <o/
